Package Management & Virtual Environments

Today, I delved into Package Management and Virtual Environments in Python, essential concepts for managing project dependencies effectively.

Key Learnings:
- Installing external packages using pip
- Understanding the significance of virtual environments in maintaining project-specific dependencies
- Creating and activating virtual environments with venv
- Installing and managing different package versions in isolated environments
- Generating a requirements.txt file for dependency management

Practice Tasks:
- Set up a virtual environment for a project
- Installed commonly used libraries like requests and numpy
- Practiced activating, deactivating, and managing dependencies within the virtual environment

Virtual environments play a crucial role in ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts across different projects.
